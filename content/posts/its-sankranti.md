The harvest festival in Andhra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra.

It is celebrated as **the** festival in parts of Andhra on the Godavari delta. I.e. people just call it **the festival**. The celebrations extend over 3 days. But there is also a 4th day called as **Mukkanuma**. Main things that happen through the course of these days are building a **bonfire on the first day**, visiting home town/parents'/grand parents' (if you are not there already) and making special chicken dishes. Unlike many other Hindu festivals prayers are not a huge part of the celebrations.

In some places, preparations for the bonfire, which is lit on the **first day (Bhogi)**, start at least a week before the actual festival. A few people come together as organizers and collect fire wood for the purpose. By asking the people in the locality for money or wood or fuel. People are usually kind enough to provide them with these items. It is not always so unassuming though! People refusing to give anything might get robbed of some stuff in the night. And did I tell you?, some of these bonfires go on for a couple of days once lit. Then there is the tradition of organizing **Rooster fights**. Though outlawed many years ago, I doubt if people want to follow law over tradition. The by-product of these fights though is specially grown free range chicken. The resulting chicken is usually tougher and more gamey than regular chicken.
