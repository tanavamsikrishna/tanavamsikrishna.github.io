Why have the urge to scribble something and say, hey.. here is a doodle for you? This is my first doodle in my doodle book. I chose to doodle about doodles as a first one.

So the hope is someone out there perusing through other doodles finds mine and thinks Hey, this is an interesting doodle!, bookmarks it, likes it and provides me with relevant comments, links my doodle pages to other pages on the internet and, and, and I guess that is the end of my imagination of what can happen when I doodle.

### But, you know what?

I have no way of knowing if anybody ever would like my doodles. But, am I going to stop doodling? No. Like the population of doodlers out there who, like me, just want to spend some time collecting their thoughts and phrasing them, as a sort of an engaging pastime.. I probably am going to doodle awaaayyy!
