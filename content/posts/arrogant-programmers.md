Are some programmers inherently arrogant to advice? If ever a programmer makes me think that running automated checks on his code is a better idea than asking him to ensure them, I would think so.

Does the job of programming have a cognitive overload? Does that lead to the programmer think in a very abstract way unable to empathise?

Do software developers have a power trip when they finally run working software? Does it get into their head? Take the perspective of a novice programmer who is writing his first `Hello world` working code. To him it appears as if he is able to make this machine print something. A computer might look like be a world apart with its apps/backgrounds/menu-bars/system-sounds etc.

The victory of writing a successful program encourages different people in different ways. (What I mean is they get encouraged to ignore other aspects and concentrate on the traits they found to be the most rewarding). The following are a few areas where the curiosity arises:

1. More into Programming
   1. Syntactical aspects of programming (worst of them all in my opinion)
   2. Technicalities of programming
   3. Design of software
2. Make more software products
   1. Just for the kick of it?
   2. To make money!
3. Or, enough is enough, now I want to help others with programming!

But, vast majority software professionals do not jump into creation of products. They continue to stay in a programmer's world.

But, they might have a genuine reason to look apprehensive about suggestions given to him. He gets suggestions from project managers, tech leads, member of other teams who rely on his software, etc. He might end up with a digressed advice if he cares too much.
